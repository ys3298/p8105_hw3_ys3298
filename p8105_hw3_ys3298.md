| Coffee Ice Cream |  13 |  14 |  15 |  15 |   15 |  12 |  13 |
| Pink Lady Apples |  13 |  11 |  11 |  14 |   11 |  12 |  11 |

From this table, we can clearly see the mean hour of the day at which

# Problem2

In 2002, CT, FL, NC, MA, NJ, PA were observed at 7 or more locations.

In 2010, CO, PA, SC, OH, MA, NY, NE, WA, CA, MD, NC, TX, NJ, FL were
observed at 7 or more
locations.

<img src="p8105_hw3_ys3298_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="90%" />

This figure has so many states information, so it’s not so clearly to
see. We notice that most of the states fluctuate from 2002 to
2010.

<img src="p8105_hw3_ys3298_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="90%" />

From the Plot, we can see the distribution of data value for reponses
among locations. “Poor” was the lowest and “Very good” and “Excellent”
and relatively high. There is difference in different locations. Form
2006 to 2010, the distribution changed a little bit.

or In this
way:

This table in not clear to see the trend. However, there are a few
number greater than 10000 and most of them come from Thursday. It’s
relatively low at the first few weeks and than increase and finally go
